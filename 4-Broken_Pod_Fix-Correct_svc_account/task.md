## Question 4 – Fix Broken Pod with Correct ServiceAccount

In namespace `monitoring`, Pod `metrics-pod` is using ServiceAccount `wrong-sa` and receiving authorization errors.

Multiple ServiceAccounts, Roles, and RoleBindings already exist in the namespace:
- ServiceAccounts: `monitor-sa`, `wrong-sa`, `admin-sa`
- Roles: `metrics-reader`, `full-access`, `view-only`
- RoleBindings: `monitor-binding`, `admin-binding`

Your task:
1. Identify which ServiceAccount/Role/RoleBinding combination has the correct permissions
2. Update Pod `metrics-pod` to use the correct ServiceAccount
3. Verify the Pod stops showing authorization errors

**Hint:** Check existing RoleBindings to see which ServiceAccount is bound to which Role.
