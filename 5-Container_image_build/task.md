## Question 5 – Build Container Image with Podman and Save as Tarball

On the node, directory `/root/app-source` contains a valid `Dockerfile`.

Your task:
1. Build a container image using Podman with name `my-app:1.0` using `/root/app-source` as build context
2. Save the image as a tarball to `/root/my-app.tar`

**Note:** The exam environment uses Podman, not Docker. Use `podman` commands.
